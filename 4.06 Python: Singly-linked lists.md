# 4.06 Python: Singly-linked lists

## Constructing the node and list class
In Python, classes are used for both the linked list and the nodes that comprise the list.   
Each class includes references to nodes (next node for the Node class and head and tail nodes for the LinkedList class).   

The Node class implements a list node with two data members, a data value and the next node in the list.   
If the node has no next node, the next data member is assigned with None, the Python term signifying the absence of a value.   

The LinkedList class implements the list data structure and contains two data members, head and tail, which are assigned to nodes once the list is populated.   
Initially the list has no nodes, so both data members are initially assigned with None.
