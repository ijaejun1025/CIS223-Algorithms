# 4.06 Python: Singly-linked lists

## Constructing the node and list class
In Python, classes are used for both the linked list and the nodes that comprise the list.   
Each class includes references to nodes (next node for the Node class and head and tail nodes for the LinkedList class).   

The **Node class** implements a list node with two data members, a data value and the next node in the list.   
If the node has no next node, the next data member is assigned with None, the Python term signifying the absence of a value.   

```python
# Node class definition and node initialization

# Class definition
class Node:
    def __init__(self, initial_data):
        self.data = initial_data
        self.next = None

# Node initialization
node_a = Node(95)  # Creates a node with a data value of 95
```

The LinkedList class implements the list data structure and contains two data members, head and tail.    
Initially the list has no nodes, so both data members are initially assigned with None.   

```python
# Singly-linked list class definition and linked list initialization

# Class definition
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None

# LinkedList initialization
num_list = LinkedList()  # Creates an empty linked list
```
