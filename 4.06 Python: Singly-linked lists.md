# 4.06 Python: Singly-linked lists

## Constructing the node and list class
In Python, classes are used for both the linked list and the nodes that comprise the list.   
Each class includes references to nodes (next node for the Node class and head and tail nodes for the LinkedList class).   

The **Node class** implements a list node with two data members, a data value and the next node in the list.   
If the node has no next node, the next data member is assigned with None, the Python term signifying the absence of a value.   

```python
# Node class definition and node initialization

# Class definition
class Node:
    def __init__(self, initial_data):
        self.data = initial_data
        self.next = None

# Node initialization
node_a = Node(95)  # Creates a node with a data value of 95
```

The **LinkedList class** implements the list data structure and contains two data members, head and tail.    
Initially the list has no nodes, so both data members are initially assigned with None.   

```python
# Singly-linked list class definition and linked list initialization

# Class definition
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None

# LinkedList initialization
num_list = LinkedList()  # Creates an empty linked list
```

## Appending a node to a singly-linked list
The ``append()`` method is a method within the LinkedList class.   
The ``append()`` method adds a node to the end of a linked list, making the node the tail of the list.   
The ``append()`` method has two parameters, the second of which is the new node to be appended to the list.   
Note that the definition for append() and all other class methods contain a self parameter.   
This parameter refers to the class object itself, and thus is not passed as an argument to the class methods.   

```python
# LinkedList append() method and method call

# append() method definition
def append(self, new_node):
    if self.head == None:
        self.head = new_node
        self.tail = new_node
    else:
        self.tail.next = new_node
        self.tail = new_node

# append() method call
node_a = Node(95)    # Creates a node with a data value of 95
node_b = Node(42)    # Creates a node with a data value of 42

num_list.append(node_a)  # Method call has one argument
num_list.append(node_b)
```

# Additional singly-linked list methods
The ``prepend()`` method adds a node to the beginning of a linked list, making the node the head of the list.   
Similarly to append(), prepend()'s second parameter is the new node to be prepended to the list.   

```python
# LinkedList prepend() method

def prepend(self, new_node):
    if self.head == None:
       self.head = new_node
       self.tail = new_node
    else:
       new_node.next = self.head
       self.head = new_node
```
