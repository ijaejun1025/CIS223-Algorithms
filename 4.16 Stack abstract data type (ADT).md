# 4.16 Stack abstract data type (ADT)

## Stack abstract data type
A **stack** is an ADT in which items are only inserted on or removed from the top of a stack.   
The stack **push** operation inserts an item on the top of the stack.   
The stack **pop** operation removes and returns the item at the top of the stack.   
Ex) After the operations "Push 7", "Push 14", "Push 9", and "Push 5", "Pop" returns 5. A second "Pop" returns 9.   
A stack is referred to as a **last-in first-out ADT**.   
A stack can be implemented using a linked list, an array, or a vector.

* A new stack named "route" is created. Items can be pushed on the top of the stack.

* Popping an item removes and returns the item from the top of the stack.

Note: Pop and Peek operations should not be applied to an empty stack; the resulting behavior may be undefined.
