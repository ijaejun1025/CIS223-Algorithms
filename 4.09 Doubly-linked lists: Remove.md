# 4.09 Doubly-linked lists: Remove

The **Remove** operation for a doubly-linked list removes a provided existing list node.   
curNode is a pointer to an existing list node.   
The algorithm first determines the node's **successor** (the next node) and **predecessor** (the previous node).   
The variable sucNode points to the node's successor, and the variable predNode points to the node's predecessor.   

The algorithm uses four separate checks to update each pointer:
* **Successor exists**
* If the successor node pointer is not null (successor exists), the algorithm points the successor's previous pointer to the predecessor node.
* **Predecessor exists**
* If the predecessor node pointer is not null (predecessor exists), the algorithm points the predecessor's next pointer to the successor node.
* **Removing list's head node**
* If curNode points to the list's head node, the algorithm points the list's head pointer to the successor node.
* **Removing list's tail node**
* If curNode points to the list's tail node, the algorithm points the list's tail pointer to the predecessor node.
