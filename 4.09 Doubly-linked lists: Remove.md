# 4.09 Doubly-linked lists: Remove

The **Remove** operation for a doubly-linked list removes a provided existing list node.   
curNode is a pointer to an existing list node.   
The algorithm first determines the node's **successor** (the next node) and **predecessor** (the previous node).   
The variable sucNode points to the node's successor, and the variable predNode points to the node's predecessor.   

The algorithm uses four separate checks to update each pointer:
* **Successor exists**   
If the successor node pointer is not null (successor exists), the algorithm points the successor's previous pointer to the predecessor node.   
* **Predecessor exists**   
If the predecessor node pointer is not null (predecessor exists), the algorithm points the predecessor's next pointer to the successor node.   
* **Removing list's head node**   
If curNode points to the list's head node, the algorithm points the list's head pointer to the successor node.   
* **Removing list's tail node**   
If curNode points to the list's tail node, the algorithm points the list's tail pointer to the predecessor node.   

1. curNode points to the node to be removed.
2. sucNode points to curNode's successor (curNode's next node). predNode points to curNode's predecessor (curNode's previous node).

3. sucNode's previous pointer is pointed to the node preceding curNode.

4. If curNode points to the list's head node, the list's head pointer is pointed to the successor node.

5. curNode points to node 5, which will be removed. sucNode points to node 2. predNode points node 4.

6. The predecessor node's next pointer is pointed to the successor node.
7. The successor node's previous pointer is pointed to the predecessor node.
8. With pointers updated, curNode can be removed.

9. curNode points to node 2, which will be removed.
10. sucNode points to nothing (null). predNode points to node 4.

11. The predecessor node's next pointer is pointed to the successor node.
12. If curNode points to the list's tail node, the list's tail pointer is assigned with predNode.
