# 4.09 Doubly-linked lists: Remove

The **Remove** operation for a doubly-linked list removes a provided existing list node.   
curNode is a pointer to an existing list node.   
The algorithm first determines the node's **successor** (the next node) and **predecessor** (the previous node).   
The variable sucNode points to the node's successor, and the variable predNode points to the node's predecessor.   

The algorithm uses four separate checks to update each pointer:
* **Successor exists**
* If the successor node pointer is not null (successor exists), the algorithm points the successor's previous pointer to the predecessor node.
