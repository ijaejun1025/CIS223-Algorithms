# 4.13 Python: Sorting linked lists

## Python insertion sort algorithm for doubly-linked lists
Insertion sort for a doubly-linked list visits all list nodes and shifts the nodes backward to be placed in the correctly sorted positions.   
The list is traversed backward to find a node's new insertion point.   

In Python, the doubly-linked list insertion sort is implemented as a method of the doubly-linked list LinkedList class because a singly-linked list cannot be traversed backward.   

To move a node backward to an earlier position in the list, the node is removed using the ```remove()``` method and re-inserted using either the prepend() or insert_after() method.
