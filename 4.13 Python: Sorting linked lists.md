# 4.13 Python: Sorting linked lists

## Python insertion sort algorithm for doubly-linked lists
Insertion sort for a doubly-linked list visits all list nodes and shifts the nodes backward to be placed in the correctly sorted positions.   
The list is traversed backward to find a node's new insertion point.   

In Python, the doubly-linked list insertion sort is implemented as a method of the doubly-linked list LinkedList class because a singly-linked list cannot be traversed backward.   

To move a node backward to an earlier position in the list, the node is removed using the `remove()` method and re-inserted using either the `prepend()` or `insert_after()` method.

## Python insertion sort variant for singly-linked lists
Insertion sort can be changed to also work for singly-linked list by traversing the list in a forwards manner to identify a node's insertion point and then using methods `prepend()` or `insert_after()` to move the node backward to the insertion point.   

In Python, the singly-linked list insertion sort is implemented as a method of the singly-linked list LinkedList class.   

The `insertion_sort_singly_linked()` method calls the `find_insertion_position()` method to move nodes to find where the current node should be located.   

`find_insertion_position()` is also a method of the LinkedList class.
