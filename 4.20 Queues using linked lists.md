# 4.20 Queues using linked lists

A queue is implemented using a linked list, with the **head node representing the queue's front, and the tail node representing the queue's end**.    
**Enqueueing** an item is performed by creating a new list node, assigning the node's data with the item, and **appending** the node to the list.   
**Dequeuing** is performed by assigning a local variable with the head node's data, **removing the head node from the list**, and returning the local variable.
