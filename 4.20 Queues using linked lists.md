# 4.20 Queues using linked lists

A queue is often implemented using a linked list.   
**list's head node representing the queue's front**, and the **list's tail node representing the queue's end**.   

* **Enqueueing**   
creating a new list node, assigning the node's data with the item, and **appending** the node to the list.   

* **Dequeuing**   
assigning a local variable with the head node's data, **removing the head node from the list**, and **returning** the local variable.   



* Enqueueing an item puts the item in a list node and appends the node to the list.
