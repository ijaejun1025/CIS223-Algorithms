# 4.25 Python: Array-based list

## Python: Array-based list
Python's built-in List type is implemented using an array-based data structure.   
To examine how an array-based lists works, this section presents an ArrayList class implementing the array-based list data structure.   
The presented implementation is similar to Python's implementation of the List type.

## append() and resize() methods
``append()`` is implemented by inserting the new item at the index equal to the array's current length.   
If the array is filled all the way to the allocation size, then the array is doubled in size first.   

``resize()`` works by first creating a new array of the indicated size, and then copying all the items in the current array to the new array.    
The array data member is then reassigned with the new array, and allocation_size is updated.
