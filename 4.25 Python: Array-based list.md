# 4.25 Python: Array-based list

## Python: Array-based list
Python's built-in List type is implemented using an array-based data structure.   
To examine how an array-based lists works, this section presents an ArrayList class implementing the array-based list data structure.   
The presented implementation is similar to Python's implementation of the List type.

## append() and resize() methods
``append()`` is implemented by inserting the new item at the index equal to the array's current length.   
If the array is filled all the way to the allocation size, then the array is doubled in size first.   

``resize()`` works by first creating a new array of the indicated size, and then copying all the items in the current array to the new array.    
The array data member is then reassigned with the new array, and allocation_size is updated.

## prepend() and insert_after() methods
The ``prepend()`` method shifts the entire contents of the array one index to the right.   
Shifting is accomplished by copying the last item to the next index, then copying the second-to-last item to the index previously occupied by the last index, and so on until the first item is copied to the location at index 1.   

To do the shifting, the loop must use the indices in reverse order, from the last item down to the first item.   
Ex) If a list's length is 5, then the loop shifts by accessing indices 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, in that order.   
The ``range()`` function is used to generate the indices 1, 2, 3, etc. up to self.length.   
The ``reversed()`` function is used to iterate backward through those indices.   
For a list of length 5, range(1, self.array.length + 1) produces the list 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.   
So reversed(range(1, self.array.length + 1)) produces the indices 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, as required.     
Since a new item is added to the list, the array is first checked to see if space is available, and resized if not.   

The ``nsert_after()`` method operates almost identically to ``prepend()``.   
Items are shifted one space to the right, but only down to the provided index plus 1.   
All items from the given index down to 0 are not shifted, creating an empty space for the new item to be inserted into.   
The combination of range() and reversed() is used again to iterate through the indices in the proper order.
