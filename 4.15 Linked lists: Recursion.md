# 4.15 Linked lists: Recursion

## Forward traversal
Forward traversal through a linked list can be implemented using a recursive function that takes a node as an argument.   
If non-null, the node is visited first. Then, a recursive call is made on the node's next pointer, to traverse the remainder of the list.   
The ListTraverse function takes a list as an argument, and searches the entire list by calling ListTraverseRecursive on the list's head.   

1. ListTraverse begins traversal by calling the recursive function, ListTraverseRecursive, on the list's head.


2. The recursive function visits the node and calls itself for the next node.


3. Nodes 19 is visited and an additional recursive call visits node 41.
4. The last recursive call encounters a null node and stops.
