# 4.05 Linked list search

Given a key, a **search** algorithm returns the first node whose data matches that key, or returns null if a matching node was not found.   
A search algorithm checks the current node, returning that node if a match, else pointing the current node to the next node and repeating.   
If the pointer to the current node is null, the algorithm returns null (matching node was not found).   

* Search starts at list's head node. If node's data matches key, matching node is returned.

* If no matching node is found, null is returned.
