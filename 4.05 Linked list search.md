# 4.05 Linked list search

Given a key, a **search** algorithm returns the first node whose data matches that key, or returns null if a matching node was not found.   
A simple linked list search algorithm checks the current node (initially the list's head node), returning that node if a match, else pointing the current node to the next node and repeating.
