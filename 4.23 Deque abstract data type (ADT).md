# 4.23 Deque abstract data type (ADT)

## Deque abstract data type
A **deque** is an ADT in which items can be inserted and removed at both the front and back.   
The ``push-front`` operation inserts an item at the front of the deque, and the ``push-back`` operation inserts at the back of the deque.   
The ``pop-front`` operation removes and returns the item at the front of the deque, and the ``pop-back`` operation removes and returns the item at the back of the deque.   
Ex: After the operations "push-back 7", "push-front 14", "push-front 9", and "push-back 5", "pop-back" returns 5. A subsequent "pop-front" returns 9.
