# 4.14 Linked list dummy nodes

## Dummy nodes
A linked list implementation may use a **dummy node**   
**Dummy node**: A node with an unused data member that always resides at the head of the list and cannot be removed.   
Using a dummy node simplifies the algorithms for a linked list because the head and tail pointers are never null.   

An empty list consists of the dummy node, which has the next pointer set to null.   
The list's head and tail pointers both point to the dummy node.
