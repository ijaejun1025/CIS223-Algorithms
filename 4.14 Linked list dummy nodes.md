# 4.14 Linked list dummy nodes

## Dummy nodes
A linked list implementation may use a **dummy node**   
**Dummy node**: A node with an unused data member that always resides at the head of the list and cannot be removed.   
Using a dummy node simplifies the algorithms for a linked list because the head and tail pointers are never null.   

An empty list consists of the dummy node, which has the next pointer set to null.   
The list's head and tail pointers both point to the dummy node.

1. An empty linked list without a dummy node has null head and tail pointers.

2. An empty linked list with a dummy node has the head and tail pointing to a node with null data.

3. Without the dummy node, a non-empty list's head pointer points to the first list item.

4. With a dummy node, the list's head pointer always points to the dummy node.
5. The dummy node's next pointer points to the first list item.

## Singly-linked list implementation
When a singly-linked list with a dummy node is created, the dummy node is allocated and the list's head and tail pointers are set to point to the dummy node.   

List operations such as ``append``, ``prepend``, ``insert after``, and ``remove after`` are simpler to implement compared to a linked list without a dummy node, since a special case is removed from each implementation.    

``ListAppend``, ``ListPrepend``, and ``ListInsertAfter`` do not need to check if the list's head is null, since the list's head will always point to the dummy node.   

``ListRemoveAfter`` does not need a special case to allow removal of the first list item, since the first list item is after the dummy node.

## Doubly-linked list implementation
A dummy node can also be used in a doubly-linked list implementation.   
The dummy node in a doubly-linked list always has the prev pointer set to null.   
ListRemove's implementation does not allow removal of the dummy node.

## Dummy head and tail nodes
A doubly-linked list implementation can also use 2 dummy nodes: one at the head and the other at the tail.   
Doing so removes additional conditionals and further simplifies the implementation of most methods.   

1. A list with 2 dummy nodes is initialized such that the list's head and tail point to 2 distinct nodes.
2. Data is null for both nodes.


3. Prepending inserts after the head.
4. The list head's next pointer is never null, even when the list is empty, because of the dummy node at the tail.


5. Appending inserts before the tail, since the list's tail pointer always points to the dummy node.
