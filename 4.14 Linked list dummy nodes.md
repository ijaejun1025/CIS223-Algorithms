# 4.14 Linked list dummy nodes

## Dummy nodes
A linked list implementation may use a **dummy node**   
**Dummy node**: A node with an unused data member that always resides at the head of the list and cannot be removed.   
Using a dummy node simplifies the algorithms for a linked list because the head and tail pointers are never null.   

An empty list consists of the dummy node, which has the next pointer set to null.   
The list's head and tail pointers both point to the dummy node.

1. An empty linked list without a dummy node has null head and tail pointers.

2. An empty linked list with a dummy node has the head and tail pointing to a node with null data.

3. Without the dummy node, a non-empty list's head pointer points to the first list item.

4. With a dummy node, the list's head pointer always points to the dummy node.
5. The dummy node's next pointer points to the first list item.
