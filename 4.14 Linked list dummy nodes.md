# 4.14 Linked list dummy nodes

## Dummy nodes
A linked list implementation may use a **dummy node**: A node with an unused data member that always resides at the head of the list and cannot be removed.   
Using a dummy node simplifies the algorithms for a linked list because the head and tail pointers are never null.
