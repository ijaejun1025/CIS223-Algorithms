# 4.1 List abstract data type (ADT)

## List abstract data type
A **list** is a common ADT for holding ordered data, having operations like append, remove, search, and print the list.   
Ex) After "Append 7", "Append 9", and "Append 5", then "Print" will print (7, 9, 5) in that order   

```python
# List ADT

# A new list named "ages" is created.
ages = new List

# Items can be appended to the list.
# The items are ordered. 
Append(ages, 55)
Append(ages, 88)
Append(ages, 66)

# Printing the list prints the items in order. 
Print(ages) # result -> {55, 88, 66}

# Removing an item keeps the remaining items in order. 
Remove(ages, 88)

# Printing the list prints the items in order. 
Print(ages) # result -> {55, 66}
```
