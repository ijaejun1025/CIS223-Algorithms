# 4.1 List abstract data type (ADT)

## List abstract data type
A **list** is a common ADT for holding ordered data, having operations like append, remove, search, and print the list.   
Ex) After "Append 7", "Append 9", and "Append 5", then "Print" will print (7, 9, 5) in that order   

```python
ages = new List
Append(ages, 55)
Append(ages, 88)
Append(ages, 66)
Print(ages)
Remove(ages, 88)
Print(ages)
```
