# 4.18 Python: Array-based stacks

## Array-based stack storage
A stack can be implemented with an array. Two variables are needed in addition to the array:   

* allocationSize: an integer for the array's allocated size.
* length: an integer for the stack's length.

The stack's **bottom item** is at ``array[0]`` and the **top item** is at ``array[length - 1]``.   
If the stack is empty, length is 0.   

* Stack 1's allocationSize and length are both 4.
* Array element 0 is at the stack's bottom.
* Array element 3 is at the stack's top.

* Stack 2's length, 2, is less than allocationSize, 4.
* So elements at indices 2 and 3 are not part of the stack content.

* The stack is empty when length is 0, regardless of array content.
