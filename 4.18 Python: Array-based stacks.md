# 4.18 Python: Array-based stacks

## Array-based stack storage
A stack can be implemented with an array. Two variables are needed in addition to the array:   

* allocationSize: an integer for the array's allocated size.
* length: an integer for the stack's length.

The stack's **bottom item** is at ``array[0]`` and the **top item** is at ``array[length - 1]``.   
If the stack is empty, length is 0.   

* **Stack 1**   
Stack 1's allocationSize and length are both 4.   
Array element 0 is at the stack's bottom.   
Array element 3 is at the stack's top.   

* **Stack 2**   
Stack 2's length, 2, is less than allocationSize, 4.   
So elements at indices 2 and 3 are not part of the stack content.   

* **Stack 3**   
The stack is empty when length is 0, regardless of array content.

## Unbounded stack
An **unbounded stack** is a stack with no upper limit on length.    
An unbounded stack's length can increase indefinitely, so the stack's array allocation size must also be able to increase indefinitely.
