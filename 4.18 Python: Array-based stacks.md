# 4.18 Python: Array-based stacks

## Array-based stack storage
A stack can be implemented with an array. Two variables are needed in addition to the array:   

* allocationSize: an integer for the array's allocated size.
* length: an integer for the stack's length.

The stack's **bottom item** is at ``array[0]`` and the **top item** is at ``array[length - 1]``.   
If the stack is empty, length is 0.   

* **Stack 1**   
Stack 1's allocationSize and length are both 4.   
Array element 0 is at the stack's bottom.   
Array element 3 is at the stack's top.   

* **Stack 2**   
Stack 2's length, 2, is less than allocationSize, 4.   
So elements at indices 2 and 3 are not part of the stack content.   

* **Stack 3**   
The stack is empty when length is 0, regardless of array content.

## Unbounded stack
An **unbounded stack** is a stack with no upper limit on length.    
An unbounded stack's length can increase indefinitely, so the stack's array allocation size must also be able to increase indefinitely.   

1. The stack's initial allocation size is 1 and length is 0. So pushing 37 assigns array[0] with 37.
2. Pushing 88 occurs when allocationSize and length are both 1.
3. So a new array is allocated, the existing entry is copied, and array[1] is assigned with 88.
4. Pushing 71 occurs when allocationSize and length are both 2.
5. So a new array is allocated, the existing entries are copied, and array[2] is assigned with 71.
