# 4.18 Python: Array-based stacks

## Array-based stack storage
A stack can be implemented with an array. Two variables are needed in addition to the array:   

* allocationSize: an integer for the array's allocated size.
* length: an integer for the stack's length.

The stack's **bottom item** is at ``array[0]`` and the **top item** is at ``array[length - 1]``.   
If the stack is empty, length is 0.   

* **Stack 1**   
Stack 1's allocationSize and length are both 4.   
Array element 0 is at the stack's bottom.   
Array element 3 is at the stack's top.   

* **Stack 2**   
Stack 2's length, 2, is less than allocationSize, 4.   
So elements at indices 2 and 3 are not part of the stack content.   

* **Stack 3**   
The stack is empty when length is 0, regardless of array content.

## Unbounded stack
An **unbounded stack** is a stack with no upper limit on length.    
An **unbounded stack's length** can increase indefinitely, so the stack's array allocation size must also be able to increase indefinitely.   

1. The stack's initial allocation size is 1 and length is 0. So pushing 37 assigns array[0] with 37.
2. Pushing 88 occurs when allocationSize and length are both 1.
3. So a new array is allocated, the existing entry is copied, and array[1] is assigned with 88.
4. Pushing 71 occurs when allocationSize and length are both 2.
5. So a new array is allocated, the existing entries are copied, and array[2] is assigned with 71.

## Bounded stack
A **bounded stack** is a stack with a length that does not exceed a maximum value.   
The maximum is commonly the **initial allocation size**.   
Ex) A bounded stack with allocationSize = 100 cannot exceed a length of 100 items.   

A bounded stack with a length equal to the maximum length is said to be **full**.   

* One implementation approach for a bounded stack is to allocate the array to the maximum length upon construction.



* Three values push successfully.



* The fourth push fails because length equals maxLength.



* An alternate bounded stack implementation may distinguish allocation size and max length.



* The first push assigns array[0] with 53. The second push must resize first, increasing allocationSize from 1 to 2.




* The next push must also resize. The min(allocationSize * 2, maxLength) = 3 is the new allocation size.




* The next push fails because length equals maxLength.
