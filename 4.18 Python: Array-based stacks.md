# 4.18 Python: Array-based stacks

## Array-based stack storage
A stack can be implemented with an array. Two variables are needed in addition to the array:   

* allocationSize: an integer for the array's allocated size.
* length: an integer for the stack's length.

The stack's **bottom item** is at ``array[0]`` and the **top item** is at ``array[length - 1]``.   
If the stack is empty, length is 0.
