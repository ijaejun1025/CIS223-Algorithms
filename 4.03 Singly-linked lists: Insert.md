# 4.03 Singly-linked lists: Insert

Given a new node, the **InsertAfter** operation for a singly-linked list inserts the new node after a provided existing list node.   
curNode is a pointer to an existing list node, but can be null when inserting into an empty list.   

The InsertAfter algorithm considers three insertion scenarios:   
* **Insert as list's first node**
* Inserting the list's first node points the list's head and tail pointers to newNode.

* **Insert after list's tail node**
* Inserting after the tail node points the tail node's next pointer to newNode.
* Then, the list's tail pointer is pointed to newNode.

* **Insert in middle of list**
* Inserting into the middle of the list points newNode's next pointer to curNode's next node.
* Then, curNode's next pointer is pointed to newNode.
