# 4.17 Stacks using linked lists

A stack is often implemented using a linked list, **with the list's head node being the stack's top**.   
A **push** is performed by creating a new list node, assigning the node's data with the item, and prepending the node to the list.   
A **pop** is performed by assigning a local variable with the head node's data, removing the head node from the list, and then returning the local variable.   

* Pushing 45 onto the stack allocates a new node and prepends the node to the list.

* Each push prepends a new node to the list.
