# 4.07 Doubly-linked lists

## Doubly-linked list
A **doubly-linked list** is a data structure for implementing a list ADT, where each node has data, pointers to the next node and previous node.   
The list structure typically points to the first node and the last node.    
The doubly-linked list's first node is called the **head**, and the last node the **tail**.   

A doubly-linked list is similar to a singly-linked list.   
However, instead of using a single pointer to the next node in the list, each node has a pointer to the next and previous nodes.   
Such a list is called "doubly-linked" because each node has **two pointers**, or "links".   
A doubly-linked list is a type of **positional list**: A list where elements contain pointers to the next and/or previous elements in the list.

## Appending a node to a doubly-linked list
Given a new node, the ``Append`` operation for a doubly-linked list inserts the new node after the list's tail node.   

The append algorithm behavior differs if the list is empty versus not empty:   
* **Append to empty list**
* If the list's head pointer is null (empty), the algorithm points the list's head and tail pointers to the new node.
* Appending an item to an empty list updates the list's head and tail pointers.
