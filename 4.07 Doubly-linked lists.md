# 4.07 Doubly-linked lists

## Doubly-linked list
A **doubly-linked list** is a data structure for implementing a list ADT, where each node has data, pointers to the next node and previous node.   
The list structure typically points to the first node and the last node.    
The doubly-linked list's first node is called the **head**, and the last node the **tail**.   

A doubly-linked list is similar to a singly-linked list.   
However, instead of using a single pointer to the next node in the list, each node has a pointer to the next and previous nodes.
