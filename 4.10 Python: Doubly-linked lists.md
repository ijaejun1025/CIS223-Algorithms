# 4.10 Python: Doubly-linked lists

## Adding a reference to the previous node
In a previous section, the LinkedList class was defined, making use of the Node class.   
The Node class can be extended from the singly-linked list to include a reference variable called prev that refers to the previous node in the list.   
When a new node is first constructed, the prev variable is assigned with None.   
Creating a doubly-linked node or a doubly-linked list is still the same as creating a singly-linked node and a singly-linked list.   

```python
# Node class definition for a doubly-linked node

class Node:
    def __init__(self, initial_data):
        self.data = initial_data
        self.next = None
        self.prev = None

# Creating a doubly-linked node and doubly-linked list

node_1 = Node(95)
num_list = LinkedList()
```

## Appending a node to a doubly-linked list
LinkedList's ``append()`` method for doubly-linked nodes is similar to the same method for singly-linked nodes, but has an added line of code.   
Before the method assigns the list's tail with the new_node, the method assigns the prev variable with the old tail of the list.   

```python
# LinkedList append() method using doubly-linked nodes

def append(self, new_node):
    if self.head == None:
        self.head = new_node
        self.tail = new_node
    else:
        self.tail.next = new_node
        new_node.prev = self.tail # the method assigns the prev variable with the old tail of the list.
        self.tail = new_node
```
