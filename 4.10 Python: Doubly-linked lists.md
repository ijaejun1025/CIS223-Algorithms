# 4.10 Python: Doubly-linked lists

## Adding a reference to the previous node
In a previous section, the LinkedList class was defined, making use of the Node class.   
The Node class can be extended from the singly-linked list to include a reference variable called prev that refers to the previous node in the list.   
When a new node is first constructed, the prev variable is assigned with None.   
Creating a doubly-linked node or a doubly-linked list is still the same as creating a singly-linked node and a singly-linked list.   

```python
# Node class definition for a doubly-linked node

class Node:
    def __init__(self, initial_data):
        self.data = initial_data
        self.next = None
        self.prev = None

# Creating a doubly-linked node and doubly-linked list

node_1 = Node(95)
num_list = LinkedList()
```

## Appending a node to a doubly-linked list
LinkedList's ``append()`` method for doubly-linked nodes is similar to the same method for singly-linked nodes, but has an added line of code.   
Before the method assigns the list's tail with the new_node, the method assigns the prev variable with the old tail of the list.   

```python
# LinkedList append() method using doubly-linked nodes

def append(self, new_node):
    if self.head == None:
        self.head = new_node
        self.tail = new_node
    else:
        self.tail.next = new_node
        new_node.prev = self.tail # the method assigns the prev variable with the old tail of the list.
        self.tail = new_node
```

## Additional doubly-linked list methods
The ``prepend()`` method inserts a new node at the head of a doubly-linked list , making the new node the head of the list.   
Additionally, the prev variable of the old head node must be set to point to the new node: ``self.head.prev = new_node``   

```python
# LinkedList prepend() method using doubly-linked nodes

def prepend(self, new_node):
   if self.head == None:
      self.head = new_node
      self.tail = new_node
   else:
      new_node.next = self.head
      self.head.prev = new_node
      self.head = new_node
```

The ``insert_after()`` method requires two node parameters.   
The new node to be inserted, and the node already in the list that will come immediately before the new node.   

Three nodes can be affected by the insert_after() method:   
* The new node (new_node), which needs both next and prev data members to be assigned.
* The existing node (current_node), whose next data member must be assigned.
* The node that currently follows current_node in the list (successor_node), whose prev data member must be assigned.

The new node's prev is assigned with current_node, the new node's next is assigned with successor_node.   
The current node's next is assigned with new_node, and the successor node's prev is assigned with new_node.   

```python
# LinkedList insert_after() method using doubly-linked nodes

def insert_after(self, current_node, new_node):
    if self.head is None:
        self.head = new_node
        self.tail = new_node
    elif current_node is self.tail:
        self.tail.next = new_node
        new_node.prev = self.tail
        self.tail = new_node
    else:
        successor_node = current_node.next
        new_node.next = successor_node
        new_node.prev = current_node
        current_node.next = new_node
        successor_node.prev = new_node
```

The ``remove()`` method unlinks a given node (current_node) from the list.   

```python
# LinkedList remove() method using doubly-linked nodes

def remove(self, current_node):
    successor_node = current_node.next
    predecessor_node = current_node.prev

    if successor_node is not None:
        successor_node.prev = predecessor_node

    if predecessor_node is not None:
        predecessor_node.next = successor_node

    if current_node is self.head:
        self.head = successor_node

    if current_node is self.tail:
        self.tail = predecessor_node
```
