# 4.12 Sorting linked lists

## Insertion sort for doubly-linked lists
Insertion sort for a doubly-linked list operates similarly to the insertion sort algorithm used for arrays.   
Starting with the second list element, each element in the linked list is visited.   
Each visited element is moved back as needed and inserted into the correct position in the list's sorted portion.   
The list must be a doubly-linked list, since backward traversal is not possible in a singly-linked list.

1. The curNode pointer begins at node 91 in the list.


2. searchNode starts at node 81 and does not move because 81 is not greater than 91.   
2. Removing and re-inserting node 91 after node 81 does not change the list.


3. For node 23, searchNode traverses the list backward until becoming null. Node 23 is prepended as the new list head.


4. Node 49 is inserted after node 23, using ListInsertAfter.

5. Node 12 is inserted before node 23, using ListPrepend, to complete the sort.
