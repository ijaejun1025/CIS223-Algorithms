# 4.12 Sorting linked lists

## Insertion sort for doubly-linked lists
Insertion sort for a doubly-linked list operates similarly to the insertion sort algorithm used for arrays.   
Starting with the second list element, each element in the linked list is visited.   
Each visited element is moved back as needed and inserted into the correct position in the list's sorted portion.   
The list must be a doubly-linked list, since backward traversal is not possible in a singly-linked list.

1. The curNode pointer begins at node 91 in the list.

2. searchNode starts at node 81 and does not move because 81 is not greater than 91.   
3. Removing and re-inserting node 91 after node 81 does not change the list.

4. For node 23, searchNode traverses the list backward until becoming null. Node 23 is prepended as the new list head.

5. Node 49 is inserted after node 23, using ListInsertAfter.

6. Node 12 is inserted before node 23, using ListPrepend, to complete the sort.

## Insertion sort for singly-linked lists
Insertion sort can sort a singly-linked list by changing how each visited element is inserted into the sorted portion of the list.   
The standard insertion sort algorithm traverses the list from the current element toward the list head to find the insertion position.   
The insertion sort algorithm can find the insertion position by traversing the list from the list head toward the current element.   

1. Insertion sort for a singly-linked list initializes curNode to point to the second list element, or node 56.

2. ListFindInsertionPosition searches the list from the head toward the current node to find the insertion position.
3. ListFindInsertionPosition returns null, so Node 56 is prepended as the list head.

4. Node 64 is less than node 71. ListFindInsertionPosition returns a pointer to the node before node 71, or node 56.
5. Then, node 64 is inserted after node 56.

6. The insertion position for node 87 is after node 71.
7. Node 87 is already in the correct position and is not moved.

8. Although node 74 is only moved back one position, ListFindInsertionPosition compared node 74 with all other nodes' values to find the insertion position.
