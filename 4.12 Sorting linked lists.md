# 4.12 Sorting linked lists

## Insertion sort for doubly-linked lists
Insertion sort for a doubly-linked list operates similarly to the insertion sort algorithm used for arrays.   
Starting with the second list element, each element in the linked list is visited.   
Each visited element is moved back as needed and inserted into the correct position in the list's sorted portion.   
The list must be a doubly-linked list, since backward traversal is not possible in a singly-linked list.

1. The curNode pointer begins at node 91 in the list.
