# 4.22 Python: Stacks and queues using linked lists

## Implementing a stack in Python
A **stack** can be implemented in Python using a class with a **single LinkedList** data member.   
The class has two methods, ``push()`` and ``pop()``.   
``push()`` adds a node to the top of the stack's list by calling LinkedList's ``prepend()`` method.   
``pop()`` removes the head of the stack's list by calling the LinkedList's ``remove_after()`` method and then returns the removed node's data.
