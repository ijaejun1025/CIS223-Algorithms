# 4.4 Singly-linked lists: Remove

Given a specified existing node in a singly-linked list, the **RemoveAfter** operation removes the node after the specified list node.   
The existing node must be specified because each node in a singly-linked list only maintains a pointer to the next node.   
The existing node is specified with the curNode parameter.   
If curNode is null, RemoveAfter removes the list's first node.   
Otherwise, the algorithm removes the node after curNode.   

* **Remove list's head node (special case)**
* If curNode is null, the algorithm points sucNode to the head node's next node, and points the list's head pointer to sucNode.
* When the argument for the current node is null, the list's head node will be removed.
* The list's head pointer is reassigned with the list head's successor node.



* If sucNode is null, the only list node was removed, so the list's tail pointer is pointed to null (indicating the list is now empty).
