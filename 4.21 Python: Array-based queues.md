# 4.21 Python: Array-based queues

## Array-based queue storage
A queue can be implemented with an array.   
Two variables are needed in addition to the array:

* length: an integer for the queue's length.
* front_index: an integer for the queue's front item index.

The queue's content starts at ``array[front_index]`` and continues forward through ``length`` items.   
If the array's end is reached before encountering all items, remaining items are stored starting at index 0.

## Bounded vs. unbounded queue
A **bounded queue** is a queue with a length that does not exceed a specified maximum value.   

An additional variable, **max_length**, is needed.   
max_length is commonly assigned at construction time and does not change for the queue's lifetime.   
A bounded queue with a length equal to the maximum length is said to be **full**.   

An **unbounded queue** is a queue with a length that can grow indefinitely.

## Flexible implementation and resize operation
An array-based queue implementation can support both bounded and unbounded queue operations by using max_length:

* If max_length is negative, the queue is unbounded.
* If max_length is nonnegative, the queue is bounded.
