# 4.21 Python: Array-based queues

## Array-based queue storage
A queue can be implemented with an array.   
Two variables are needed in addition to the array:

* length: an integer for the queue's length.
* front_index: an integer for the queue's front item index.

The queue's content starts at ``array[front_index]`` and continues forward through ``length`` items.   
If the array's end is reached before encountering all items, remaining items are stored starting at index 0.
