# 4.21 Python: Array-based queues

## Array-based queue storage
A queue can be implemented with an array.   
Two variables are needed in addition to the array:

* length: an integer for the queue's length.
* front_index: an integer for the queue's front item index.

The queue's content starts at ``array[front_index]`` and continues forward through ``length`` items.   
If the array's end is reached before encountering all items, remaining items are stored starting at index 0.

## Bounded vs. unbounded queue
A **bounded queue** is a queue with a length that does not exceed a specified maximum value.   

An additional variable, **max_length**, is needed.   
max_length is commonly assigned at construction time and does not change for the queue's lifetime.   
A bounded queue with a length equal to the maximum length is said to be **full**.   

An **unbounded queue** is a queue with a length that can grow indefinitely.

## Flexible implementation and resize operation
An array-based queue implementation can support both bounded and unbounded queue operations by using max_length:

* If max_length is negative, the queue is unbounded.
* If max_length is nonnegative, the queue is bounded.

The Python implementation uses a list named queue_list to store queue items.   
``len(queue_list)`` is the queue's allocation size.   
The list is used much like a fixed size array.   
So the resize operation creates a larger list, commonly double the length of the current list.   
If max_length is nonnegative, the new list's length is the minimum of max_length and double the current list's length.    
Existing list entries are copied in such a way that the front index is reset to 0.

## Enqueue and dequeue operations
An enqueue operation:

1. Compares ``self.length`` and ``self.max_length``. If equal, the queue is full and so no change occurs and False is returned.
2. Compares ``self.length`` and ``len(self.queue_list)``. If equal, a resize operation occurs.
3. Computes the enqueued item's index as ``(self.front_index + self.length) % len(self.queue_list)`` and assigns to ``queue_list`` at that index.
4. Ex) Enqueueing 42 into a queue with front index 2, length 3, and queue_list length 8 assigns queue_list at index (2 + 3) % 8 = 5 with 42.
5. Increments the length attribute and then returns True.
