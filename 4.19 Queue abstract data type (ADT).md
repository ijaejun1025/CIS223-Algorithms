# 4.19 Queue abstract data type (ADT)

## Queue abstract data type
A **queue** is an ADT in which items are inserted at the end of the queue and removed from the front of the queue.   
The queue **enqueue** operation inserts an item at the **end of the queue**.   
The queue **dequeue** operation removes and returns the item at **the front of the queue**.   
A queue is referred to as a **first-in first-out** ADT.   
A queue can be implemented using a linked list or an array.   

* A new queue named "wQueue" is created. Items are enqueued to the end of the queue.
