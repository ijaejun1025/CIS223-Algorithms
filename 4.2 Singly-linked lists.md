# 4.2 Singly-linked lists

## Singly-linked list data structure
A **singly-linked list** is a data structure for implementing a list ADT, where each node has data and a pointer to the next node.   
The list structure typically has pointers to the list's first node and last node.   
A singly-linked list's first node is called the **head**, and the last node the **tail**.   
A singly-linked list is a type of **positional list**: A list where elements contain pointers to the next and/or previous elements in the list.

## Appending a node to a singly-linked list
Given a new node, the **Append** operation for a singly-linked list inserts the new node after the list's tail node.   
Ex) ListAppend(numsList, node 45) appends node 45 to numsList.   

The append algorithm behavior differs if the list is empty versus not empty.   
* **Append to empty list**
* If the list's head pointer is null (empty), the algorithm points the list's head and tail pointers to the new node.
* Appending an item to an empty list updates both the list's head and tail pointers.

* **Append to non-empty list**   
* If the list's head pointer is not null (not empty), the algorithm points the tail node's next pointer and the list's tail pointer to the new node.
* Appending to a non-empty list adds the new node after the tail node and updates the tail pointer.
