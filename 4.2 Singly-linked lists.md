# 4.2 Singly-linked lists

## Singly-linked list data structure
A **singly-linked list** is a data structure for implementing a list ADT, where each node has data and a pointer to the next node.   
The list structure typically has pointers to the list's first node and last node.   
A singly-linked list's first node is called the **head**, and the last node the **tail**.   
A singly-linked list is a type of **positional list**: A list where elements contain pointers to the next and/or previous elements in the list.
