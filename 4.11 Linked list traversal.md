# 4.11 Linked list traversal

## Linked list traversal
A **list traversal** algorithm visits all nodes in the list once and performs an operation on each node.   
A common traversal operation prints all list nodes.    
The algorithm starts by pointing a curNode pointer to the list's head node.   
While curNode is not null, the algorithm prints the current node, and then points curNode to the next node.   
After the list's tail node is visited, curNode is pointed to the tail node's next node, which does not exist (null).   
The traversal algorithm supports both singly-linked and doubly-linked lists.   

```python
# Linked list traversal algorithm

ListTraverse(list) {
   curNode = list⇢head // Start at head

   while (curNode is not null) { 
      Print curNode's data        
      curNode = curNode⇢next
   }
}
```

1. Traverse starts at the list's head node.

2. curNode's data is printed, and then curNode is pointed to the next node.

3. After the list's tail node is printed, curNode is pointed to the tail node's next node, which does not exist.
