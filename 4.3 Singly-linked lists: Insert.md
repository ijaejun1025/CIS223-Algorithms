# 4.3 Singly-linked lists: Insert

Given a new node, the **InsertAfter** operation for a singly-linked list inserts the new node after a provided existing list node.   
curNode is a pointer to an existing list node, but can be null when inserting into an empty list.   

The InsertAfter algorithm considers three insertion scenarios:   
* **Insert as list's first node**
* If the list's head pointer is null, the algorithm points the list's head and tail pointers to the new node.
* Inserting the list's first node points the list's head and tail pointers to newNode.



* **Insert after list's tail node**
* If the list's head pointer is not null (list not empty) and curNode points to the list's tail node, the algorithm points the tail node's next pointer and the list's tail pointer to the new node.
