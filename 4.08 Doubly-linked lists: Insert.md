# 4.08 Doubly-linked lists: Insert

Given a new node, the **InsertAfter** operation for a doubly-linked list inserts the new node after a provided existing list node.   
curNode is a pointer to an existing list node.    

The InsertAfter algorithm considers three insertion scenarios:   
* **Insert as first node**
1. Inserting a first node into the list points the list's head and tail pointers to the new node.

* **Insert after list's tail node**
1. Inserting after the list's tail node points the tail node's next pointer to the new node.
