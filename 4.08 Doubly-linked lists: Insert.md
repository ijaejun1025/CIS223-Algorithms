# 4.08 Doubly-linked lists: Insert

Given a new node, the **InsertAfter** operation for a doubly-linked list inserts the new node after a provided existing list node.   
curNode is a pointer to an existing list node.    

The InsertAfter algorithm considers three insertion scenarios:   
* **Insert as first node**
1. Inserting a first node into the list points the list's head and tail pointers to the new node.

* **Insert after list's tail node**
1. Inserting after the list's tail node points the tail node's next pointer to the new node.

2. Then the new node's previous pointer is pointed to the list's tail node.
3. Finally, the list's tail pointer is pointed to the new node.

* **Insert in middle of list**
1. Inserting in the middle of a list points sucNode to curNode's successor (curNode's next node).
2. Then points newNode's next pointer to the successor node.

3. Then points newNode's previous pointer to curNode.

4. And finally points curNode's next pointer to the new node.

5. Finally, points sucNode's previous pointer to the new node.
6. At most, four pointers are updated to insert a new node in the list.
