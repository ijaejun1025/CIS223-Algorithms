# 4.24 Array-based lists

## Array-based lists
An **array-based list** is a list ADT implemented using an array.   
An array-based list supports the common list ADT operations, such as append, prepend, insert after, remove, and search.   

In many programming languages, arrays have a fixed size.   
An array-based list implementation will dynamically allocate the array as needed as the number of elements changes.   
The array-based list implementation allocates a fixed size array and uses a length variable to keep track of how many array elements are in use.   
The list starts with a default allocation size, greater than or equal to 1.   
A default size of 1 to 10 is common.   

Given a new element, the **append** operation for an array-based list of length X inserts the new element at the end of the list, or at index X.

An array-based list must be resized if an item is added when the allocation size equals the list length.   
A new array is allocated with a length greater than the existing array.   
Allocating the new array with twice the current length is a common approach.   
The existing array elements are then copied to the new array, which becomes the list's storage array.   

1. The allocation size and length of the list are both 4. An append operation cannot add to the existing array.

2. To resize, a new array is allocated of size 8, and the existing elements are copied to the new array.
3. The new array replaces the list's array.



4. 51 can now be appended to the array.
