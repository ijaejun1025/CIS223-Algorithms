# 4.24 Array-based lists

## Array-based lists
An **array-based list** is a list ADT implemented using an array.   
An array-based list supports the common list ADT operations, such as append, prepend, insert after, remove, and search.   

In many programming languages, arrays have a fixed size.   
An array-based list implementation will dynamically allocate the array as needed as the number of elements changes.   
The array-based list implementation allocates a fixed size array and uses a length variable to keep track of how many array elements are in use.   
The list starts with a default allocation size, greater than or equal to 1.   
A default size of 1 to 10 is common.   

Given a new element, the **append** operation for an array-based list of length X inserts the new element at the end of the list, or at index X.

An array-based list must be resized if an item is added when the allocation size equals the list length.   
A new array is allocated with a length greater than the existing array.   
Allocating the new array with twice the current length is a common approach.   
The existing array elements are then copied to the new array, which becomes the list's storage array.   

1. The allocation size and length of the list are both 4. An append operation cannot add to the existing array.

2. To resize, a new array is allocated of size 8, and the existing elements are copied to the new array.
3. The new array replaces the list's array.

4. 51 can now be appended to the array.

## Prepend and insert after operations
The **Prepend** operation for an array-based list inserts a new item at the start of the list.   
First, if the allocation size equals the list length, the array is resized.   
Then all existing array elements are moved up by 1 position, and the new item is inserted at the list start, or index 0.   

The **InsertAfter** operation for an array-based list inserts a new item after a specified index.   
Ex) If the contents of numbersList is: 5, 8, 2, ArrayListInsertAfter(numbersList, 1, 7) produces: 5, 8, 7, 2.   
First, if the allocation size equals the list length, the array is resized.   
Next, all elements in the array residing after the specified index are moved up by 1 position.   
Then, the new item is inserted at index (specified index + 1) in the list's array.

* To prepend 91, every array element is first moved up one index.

* Item 91 is assigned to index 0 and length is incremented to 6.

* Inserting item 36 after index 2 requires elements at indices 3 and higher to be moved up 1.
* Item 36 is inserted at index 3.

## Search and removal operations
Given a key, the **search** operation returns the index for the first element whose data matches that key, or -1 if not found.   
Given the index of an item in an array-based list, the **remove-at** operation removes the item at that index.   
When removing an item at index X, each item after index X is moved down by 1 position.   

* The search for 84 compares against 3 elements before returning 2.



* Removing the element at index 1 causes all elements after index 1 to be moved down to a lower index.




* Decreasing the length by 1 effectively removes the last 51.




* The search for 84 now returns 1.
