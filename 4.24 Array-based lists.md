# 4.24 Array-based lists

## Array-based lists
An **array-based list** is a list ADT implemented using an array.   
An array-based list supports the common list ADT operations, such as append, prepend, insert after, remove, and search.   

In many programming languages, arrays have a fixed size.   
An array-based list implementation will dynamically allocate the array as needed as the number of elements changes.   
The array-based list implementation allocates a fixed size array and uses a length variable to keep track of how many array elements are in use.   
The list starts with a default allocation size, greater than or equal to 1.   
A default size of 1 to 10 is common.   

Given a new element, the **append** operation for an array-based list of length X inserts the new element at the end of the list, or at index X.
